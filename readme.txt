== Description ==

= Accept Bitcoin Donations with Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation! =

Enable the visitors on your WordPress website to make donations with Bitcoin wherever you want. Make it extremely simple to donate with a scan and a click, or gather your donors contact data for later interactions or even let them make a shoutout and display all shoutouts next to the donation form or an a dedicated website.

With the Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation plugin you only need a Lightning wallet with a Lightning address, a Coinsnap account, and a minute to set up the plugin to accept Bitcoin Lightning payments on your WordPress website.

With this plugin you can then present donation boxes anywhere on your website – in the content, in a sidebar, in the footer – anywhere you please! And, of course, you do not need a payment provider or a shop system or anything but a Lightning wallet and a Coinsnap account to start receiving donations in Bitcoin!

Coinsnap’s Bitcoin Donation plugin for WordPress makes it amazingly simple for your customers to make a donation with Bitcoin-Lightning: They can send their contribution with just a scan of the QR code generated by the Coinsnap plugin, and their authorization of the payment. When authorized, the payment will be credited directly and immediately to your Lightning wallet.

The Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation plugin works with the Coinsnap Gateway as well as with your BTCPay Server - the choice is yours. The Coinsnap gateway is perfect for everyone who is not a skilled bitcoiner and doesn’t run his own Lightning nodes or BTCPay Server. If you DO have a BTCPay Server, the plugin can easily be connected with it, so all payments are transacted on your own payment gateway!
